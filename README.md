# **Business Data Analysis Capstone Project Proposal**

## **Project Overview**

In this specialization, I will undertake a Capstone Project focused on data analysis to provide recommendations for enhancing profits for Watershed Property Management, Inc. Watershed is responsible for overseeing a large portfolio of residential rental properties across the United States. My objective is to convince Watershed's management team to adopt a new property management strategy aimed at increasing their profitability.

## **Project Scope**

Watershed has an immediate opportunity to explore the short-term rental market in collaboration with one of its key property owners. This property owner has expressed interest in partnering with Watershed to convert a portion of their long-term rental properties into short-term rentals. As a business data analyst, Watershed has entrusted me with the following tasks:

1. Calculate the conversion and maintenance costs associated with each of the client's properties if they were to be converted into short-term rentals.

2. Determine the optimal nightly rental price for each property that would maximize profits if converted to short-term rentals.

3. Calculate which properties would experience increased profitability if transitioned to short-term rentals.

4. Determine the overall profitability of converting some of the client's properties into short-term rentals.

5. Calculate the financial resources required by Watershed to realize potential profits from property conversion.

## **Business Recommendation**

The culmination of this analysis will lead to a concise and data-driven business recommendation:

Should Watershed enter the short-term rental market by utilizing a portion of this client's property portfolio? If the answer is affirmative, which specific properties should be prioritized for conversion?
